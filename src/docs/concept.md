# Concept Summary

Independent professionals struggle with missed or fragmented obligations because tasks arrive through many channels and depend too much on memory or informal processes. The target audience is visually impaired independent professionals managing high volumes of incoming work. The solution is an assistive task-orchestration system that turns messages, documents, and requests into clear, trackable actions. By reducing cognitive load and improving follow-through, the system helps users stay reliable, compliant, and in control without needing constant assistance.
