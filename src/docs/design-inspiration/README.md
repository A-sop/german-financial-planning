# Create Your Design Mood Board

- [Style Systems — Level 3 — Pirate Skills](https://pirateskills.com/build/codex/level-3/style-systems)

Browse the recommended resources and collect examples:

1. **Screenshot 3–5 designs** that feel right for your product
2. **Focus on individual components** (buttons, cards, forms) rather than full pages
3. **Look for consistency** in spacing, colors, typography, and overall feel
4. **Consider your users** — will this style help or distract from their goals?

**Save screenshots in:** `src/docs/design-inspiration/`

**Name them descriptively:** `button-style.png`, `card-layout.png`, `color-palette.png`, etc.

**Outcome:** You have 3–5 design screenshots that represent your desired style direction.
