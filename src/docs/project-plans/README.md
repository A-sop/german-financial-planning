# Project Plans — Spin-off MVPs

Plans for creating new projects from this codebase. Use when cloning to build:

- **logan-williams-personal-website-plan.md** — Logan Williams personal site (no login, insights-style blog)
- **german-financial-planning-website-plan.md** — German Financial Planning site (login, blog, eventual planner app)

Each plan includes: clone steps, what to strip/keep, AI prompts, and deployment notes.

## ⚠️ Cleanup reminder

**After a spin-off project is live:** Return to this source project (`my-app`) and delete any data or content you copied over that doesn't belong here. Keep `my-app` focused on CM / Builder Codex SaaS only.
