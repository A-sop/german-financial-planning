# logans.tools — Website Plan

**Goal:** Simple UI that shows Logan's projects, how he works on them, AI tools in use, and a plug for Pirate Skills. Evolve to showcase Logan's own work as it grows.

**Domain:** logans.tools (and subdomains e.g. cm.logans.tools for apps)

**Linear:** LT prefix (e.g. A-75)

---

## Phase 1 — Now

**Simple UI with:**
- Overview of projects (LDW, GFP, LT, CM — or whichever are active)
- How Logan is working on them (process, stack, approach)
- AI tools in use (Cursor, etc.)
- **Plug Pirate Skills** — Ben's work; credit and link
- Clean, minimal. Dark theme preferred.

**Design:** Same inspiration as LDW — Pirate Skills, Urban Finance. No login for Phase 1.

---

## Phase 2 — Later

- Show Logan's own tools/work as it grows
- Add projects as they ship
- Optionally: blog, changelog, or "building in public" updates

---

## Tech (suggested)

- Next.js, Tailwind, simple static or near-static
- Or: single HTML + CSS if you want ultra-minimal
- Deploy: Vercel or similar

---

## Prompt for AI (when building)

```
Create a minimal website for logans.tools with:

**Phase 1:**
- Hero: Logan's tools and projects hub
- Section: Projects overview (what's being worked on: loganwilliams.com, GFP, etc.)
- Section: How I work (stack, process, AI tools like Cursor)
- Section: Pirate Skills — plug/link to Ben's work (pirateskills.com). Credit for inspiration.
- Dark theme, clean, minimal. No login.

**Phase 2:** Space to add Logan's own shipped tools later.

Tech: Next.js + Tailwind or simple static. Deploy to Vercel.
```
