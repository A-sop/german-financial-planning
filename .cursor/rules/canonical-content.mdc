# Canonical (Allfinanz) German content

When German content is taken from the canonical Allfinanz site (https://www.allfinanz.ag/logan.williams/), follow these rules so the GFP site does not compete with the source in search and stays compliant.

**When this applies:** Initial phase when bringing over German content from Allfinanz, and for blog posts (Finanztipps) that are sourced from the canonical. Not for all German content indefinitely.

## SEO: Mark content as sourced

- **Canonical URL:** On any page that republishes German content from the canonical, set the HTML canonical to the **source** URL, not the GFP URL.
  - In Next.js: in `metadata` or `generateMetadata`, set `alternates.canonical` to the full Allfinanz URL for that page/article.
- **Structured data (optional):** For articles, in JSON-LD include the source, e.g. `isBasedOn: { "@type": "CreativeWork", url: "https://www.allfinanz.ag/..." }` or a `citation` property pointing to the source URL.

## Content: Truncate and link to source

- **Heavily truncate:** On GFP, show only a short summary or excerpt (e.g. 1–3 sentences or a single paragraph). Do not republish the full article body.
- **Link to source:** Always provide a clear, prominent link to the full article/page on the canonical site (e.g. "Weiterlesen auf Allfinanz" / "Read full article at source") using the exact source URL. Use `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

## Drip-feed and timeless posts

- **Drip-feed:** Publish at most one post per category per day (Vorsorge, Finanzen) until the site is caught up.
- **Timeless only:** Use only evergreen posts. Exclude year-specific posts (e.g. "Änderungen 2026", "Rentenerhöhung 2025"); compile those into a single "What's changing" article with latest at top and "Last updated DD/MM/YYYY".

## How to add a canonical post (Finanztipps)

- **Location:** One Markdown file per post in `content/insights/`. Filename = URL slug (e.g. `altersvorsorge-basics.md` → `/financial-tips/retirement/altersvorsorge-basics`).
- **Required frontmatter:** `title`, `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `excerpt`, `topic`, and **`canonicalSource`** (full URL to the source article on Allfinanz).
- **Draft:** Optional `draft: true` excludes the post from hub, category lists, and sitemap in production; the post remains viewable by direct URL. Use for work-in-progress; remove or set `draft: false` when publishing.
- **Topic values:** Use `life-in-germany` or `vorsorge` for Retirement; use `personal-finance` or `finanzen` for Finances. These map to the English URL segments `retirement` and `finances`.
- **Canonical behaviour:** When `canonicalSource` is set, the GFP page behaviour is locale-dependent. **DE:** only the excerpt and a prominent "Weiterlesen auf Allfinanz" link (truncate). **EN:** full body is shown with an italic note at the top: "This article was first published on [Allfinanz](url)." The HTML canonical and JSON-LD `isBasedOn` point to the source URL in both cases.
- **Body:** For canonical posts the body is shown in full only in the English view; in the German view only the excerpt is shown. For non-canonical (own) posts, the body is rendered in full for both locales.
