# Linear Task Management & Prefix System

**Purpose:** Structured task ownership, permission, and execution scope across multi-product, human-in-the-loop system.

**Context:** This system applies to all projects. The current app (`my-app`) is a learning/test case for **CM (Consulting & More)**.

---

## Prefix Structure

All Linear issues and tasks use structured prefixes:

```
[OWNER]-[DOMAIN]-[SURFACE] Task description
```

### OWNERS (Project Identifiers)

| Prefix | Owner | Project |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `CM` | Consulting & More | Reza's business / concierge system (this app is a test case for CM) |
| `LDW` | Logan Williams | Logan's personal branding website |
| `LT` | Logan Tools | Productised internal or external tools |
| `GFP` | German Financial Planning | Regulated financial planning business (high compliance sensitivity) |

**Note:** Owner prefixes identify **which project** the task belongs to, not permission level.

### DOMAINS (Permission & Scope)

| Prefix | Domain | Permission | Scope |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|
| `BIZ` | Business | **Human Required** | Big picture, strategy, content, compliance, outreach, positioning, marketing, one-way-door decisions |
| `OPS` | Operations | **Human-in-the-loop** | Day-to-day operational work, recurring tasks, running existing processes for real clients |
| `DEV` | Development | **Can Execute** | Code, systems, automation, infrastructure, technical implementation |

**Key Rule:** 
- **`-BIZ-`** = Strategic / directional decisions → humans decide, AI assists.
- **`-OPS-`** = Operative daily work → humans act, AI prepares/checklists/automation.
- **`-DEV-`** = Technical implementation → AI can execute autonomously in code.

### SURFACES (Optional)

| Prefix | Surface | Scope |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `WEB` | Web | Public website, landing pages, marketing site |
| `APP` | Application | Dashboard, system, authenticated app interface |

**Note:** If SURFACE is omitted, task applies across all surfaces.

## Execution Rules

### 1. -BIZ- Tasks (Human Required – Strategy & Direction)

**Rule:** Any task with `-BIZ-` requires **human judgment, decisions, or approval**.

**Why:** Business tasks involve big picture thinking, strategy, content decisions, compliance, positioning - these require human judgment.

**Allowed:**
- ✅ Draft, outline, suggest, or prepare materials
- ✅ Research and present options
- ✅ Create content drafts for review
- ✅ Propose strategies or approaches

**Forbidden:**
- ❌ Making final decisions autonomously
- ❌ Publishing content without approval
- ❌ Assuming business strategy without confirmation
- ❌ Finalizing compliance or positioning decisions

**Examples:**
- `CM-BIZ`: "Draft pricing strategy options" → Draft options, human decides
- `CM-BIZ-WEB`: "Update pricing page copy" → Draft copy, human approves
- `GFP-BIZ`: "Research GDPR requirements" → Research and present, human decides approach
- `LDW-BIZ`: "Define personal brand messaging" → Draft options, human chooses

### 2. -OPS- Tasks (Operations – Daily Work)

**Rule:** Any task with `-OPS-` is about **running the machine**: real-world, often repeatable work for actual clients or the business.

**Why:** OPS tasks are where strategy (BIZ) and systems (DEV) meet real people and money. They must stay human-in-the-loop, even when highly templated or automated.

**Typical examples:**
- CM-OPS: Running concierge workflows, updating assignments, sending prepared messages.
- GFP-OPS: Preparing and sending regulated documents (using approved templates), logging client interactions.
- LDW-OPS: Publishing pre-approved blog posts, updating portfolio entries.
- LT-OPS: Operating internal tools, running scheduled jobs that affect real data.

**Allowed (for me):**
- ✅ Design and refine checklists and SOPs.
- ✅ Draft messages, emails, and documents for you to send.
- ✅ Generate scripts/queries to run (you execute).
- ✅ Suggest automations (n8n flows, cron jobs, agents).

**Forbidden (for me):**
- ❌ Directly triggering irreversible or external actions (sending emails, charging cards, changing production data) unless you explicitly say “go ahead and execute this”.
- ❌ Deciding on exceptions (e.g. waiving fees, making one-off promises) — that’s BIZ.

**Examples:**
- `CM-OPS-APP`: “Process today’s new client intakes in the workspace” → I can give you a checklist; you run it.
- `GFP-OPS-WEB`: “Send monthly regulatory reminder emails” → I draft templates; you send or schedule them.
- `LDW-OPS-WEB`: “Publish this pre-approved case study” → I prepare content and steps; you click publish.

### 3. -DEV- Tasks (Can Execute – Technical)

**Rule:** Tasks with `-DEV-` can be **executed autonomously** (write code, implement features, fix bugs).

**Why:** Development tasks are technical implementation - these can be done autonomously.

**Allowed:**
- ✅ Write code, refactor, generate files
- ✅ Implement features as requested
- ✅ Create migrations, update configs
- ✅ Fix bugs, optimize performance
- ✅ Set up infrastructure
- ✅ Deploy (unless marked otherwise)

**When to Ask:**
- ⚠️ If requirements are unclear
- ⚠️ If implementation approach needs approval
- ⚠️ If it affects business logic or user experience significantly

**Examples:**
- `CM-DEV`: "Implement feedback modal component" → Execute directly
- `CM-DEV-APP`: "Add user profile page" → Execute directly
- `LDW-DEV`: "Build portfolio gallery component" → Execute directly
- `LT-DEV`: "Add API rate limiting middleware" → Execute directly
- `GFP-DEV`: "Add audit logging feature" → Execute, but ensure compliance requirements met

### 4. GFP Tasks (Regulatory Sensitivity)

**Rule:** GFP tasks must be handled **conservatively** due to regulatory compliance.

**Principles:**
- Assume regulatory, trust, and compliance sensitivity
- Prefer clarity, restraint, and reliability over creativity or growth hacks
- When in doubt, ask before proceeding
- Document compliance considerations

**Applies to both BIZ and DEV:**
- `GFP-BIZ`: Business decisions require extra care (compliance, regulatory)
- `GFP-DEV`: Technical implementation must meet compliance requirements

**Examples:**
- `GFP-BIZ`: "Draft client communication" → Conservative, compliant tone, human approves
- `GFP-DEV`: "Add audit logging" → Ensure compliance requirements met, can execute

### 5. CM Tasks (Client Project)

**Rule:** CM tasks are for Reza's business (Consulting & More).

**Guidelines:**
- `CM-BIZ` tasks require alignment with Reza's intent (human decides)
- `CM-DEV` tasks can be executed, but ask if unclear
- This app (`my-app`) is a learning/test case for CM
- Treat CM tasks as if building for a client (respect their vision)

**Examples:**
- `CM-DEV`: "Add feature X" → Implement, but confirm if unclear
- `CM-BIZ`: "Update pricing page copy" → Draft options, confirm with Reza

### 6. LDW Tasks (Personal Project)

**Rule:** LDW tasks are for Logan's personal branding website.

**Guidelines:**
- `LDW-BIZ` tasks require Logan's decisions (personal brand, messaging)
- `LDW-DEV` tasks can be executed autonomously (technical implementation)

**Examples:**
- `LDW-DEV`: "Build portfolio gallery" → Execute directly
- `LDW-BIZ`: "Define personal brand messaging" → Draft options, Logan decides

## General Behavior

### Prefix Enforcement

- **Always respect the prefix system as a permission gate**
- **`-BIZ-` = Strategy/decisions (human-led)**
- **`-OPS-` = Operations (human-in-the-loop, AI assists)**
- **`-DEV-` = Technical implementation (AI can execute in code)**
- **If a task's prefix is ambiguous or missing, ask for clarification before proceeding**
- **When in doubt, default to ASSIST, not EXECUTE**

### Missing Prefixes

**Default behavior for tasks without prefixes:**
- If in `my-app` (CM test case): Treat as `CM-DEV` (can execute, but ask if unclear)
- If in other projects: Ask for clarification
- Never assume ownership or execution permission

### Status Indicators

When updating Linear issues, use clear status language:

- **`[Human Review]` in title/description:** Human action required (for BIZ tasks or DEV tasks needing approval)
- **`✅ Ready for review`:** Code/files ready, waiting for human approval
- **`⏳ Blocked on [X]`:** Waiting for prerequisite
- **`🔄 In progress`:** Actively working (agent or human)

### Cross-Project Context

**This app (`my-app`):**
- Learning/test case for **CM (Consulting & More)**
- Happens to be live (testing for Reza's business)
- Use `CM-` prefix for all tasks related to this project
- `CM-DEV` = Development tasks (can execute)
- `CM-BIZ` = Business tasks (human required)

**Other projects:**
- **LDW** = Logan's personal branding website
- **LT** = Logan Tools (productized tools)
- **GFP** = German Financial Planning (regulated business)
- Apply same prefix system across all projects
- When creating issues, always include appropriate prefix

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Usage

```
CM-DEV-APP: Implement feedback modal component
CM-BIZ-WEB: Draft pricing page copy (3 options for review)
LDW-DEV: Build portfolio gallery component
LDW-BIZ: Define personal brand messaging (draft options)
GFP-BIZ: Research GDPR requirements for client data storage
GFP-DEV: Add audit logging feature
LT-DEV: Add API rate limiting middleware
```

### ❌ Incorrect Usage

```
Implement payment system (missing prefix - ask for clarification)
CM-DEV: Review payment implementation PR (should be CM-BIZ if review/decision needed)
CM-BIZ: Publish pricing page (should be "Draft pricing page" - publishing requires approval)
LDW-DEV: Human required task (LDW is project, not "human required" - use CM-BIZ or add [Human Review])
```

### Clarification Examples

**If you see:**
- `CM-DEV: Implement feature X` → ✅ Execute directly
- `CM-BIZ: Decide on pricing strategy` → ✅ Draft options, wait for human decision
- `LDW-DEV: Build contact form` → ✅ Execute directly (LDW is project, DEV means can execute)
- `LDW-BIZ: Write about page copy` → ✅ Draft copy, wait for human approval (LDW is project, BIZ means human required)

## Integration with Linear

**When creating Linear issues:**
1. Always include prefix in title: `[OWNER]-[DOMAIN]-[SURFACE] Description`
2. Use `-BIZ-` for business/strategy/content tasks (human required)
3. Use `-DEV-` for development/technical tasks (can execute)
4. Add prefix explanation in description if context needed

**When updating Linear issues:**
1. Respect prefix permissions (`-BIZ-` = human required, `-DEV-` = can execute)
2. Update status clearly (Ready for review, Blocked, In progress)
3. Add `[Human Review]` tag in description if human action needed mid-task

**For this project (my-app):**
- All tasks should use `CM-` prefix (Consulting & More)
- Strategy/positioning/pricing: `CM-BIZ` (human required)
- Day-to-day concierge ops / running flows: `CM-OPS` (human-in-the-loop)
- Development: `CM-DEV` (can execute)
